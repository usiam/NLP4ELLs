# NLP4ELLs
### Final project for Deep Learning CSC 298 offered at the University of Rochester.

Project Team Members: Uzair Tahamid Siam, Runtao Zhou, Nina Long

Writing is a foundational skill that few students are able
to master, often because writing tasks are infrequently as-
signed in school. A rapidly growing student population,
students learning English as a second language, known as
English Language Learners (ELLs), are especially affected
by the lack of practice. In this project we create an au-
tomated system using a Long short-term memory (LSTM)
and a pretrained BERT model to score essays of ELLs from
grades 8 − 12 on 6 measures.
